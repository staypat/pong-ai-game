This repository features a simple remake of Pong, but it is single-player and the player is against a simple AI.

To play, clone the repository onto your local machine using git clone. Then, run the program by typing `python AIPong.py` into the terminal.

**Make sure the machine has Python installed!**

Player controls are `W` to move up and `S` to move down. First to five points win.
